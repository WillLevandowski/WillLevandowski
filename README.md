Hello! Thanks for visiting my Github / home page.

Here you will find repositories related to several of my research interests, past projects, and ongoing studies. 
These repositories contain code (almost all for MATLAB), metadata and documentation, and some figures and publications.
You are free to use any of the code you find here for non-profit purposes. Please cite the related publication, if there is one.
Better yet, let's collaborate! I would love to help apply any of these methods to new problems, new datasets, or new regions.

About Me
~~~~~~~~
My professional / scientific time is divided between consulting work with Tetra Tech, Inc. and independent, sometimes funded, 
earthquake seismology and tectonics research. 
At Tetra Tech, I am a Senior Geophysicist in the geohazards group. We specialize in geophysical applications to tough geotechnical
problems (e.g., for construction and major infrastructure). I have found a niche in using "microgravity surveys" (i.e., microGal-
precision relative gravity measurements) for subsurface imaging at depths from several meters to a few km. Microgravity is my tool
of choice for mapping shallow geology, such as fault delineation, fault zone characterization, 3D modeling of buried 
paleochannels / paleotopography, and karst / void detection. Karst and other voids are our specialty. The most distinctive mainstay
of our work is finding, mapping, and eventually remediating abandoned coal mines, and particularly acrtive underground coal mine 
fires.
