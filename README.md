Hello! Thanks for visiting Will Levandowskiâ€™s Github / home page.

Here you will find repositories related to several of my research interests, past projects, and ongoing studies. 
These repositories contain code (almost all for MATLAB), metadata and documentation, and some figures and publications.
You are free to use any of the code you find here for non-profit purposes. Please cite the related publication, if there is one.
Better yet, let's collaborate! I would love to help apply any of these methods to new problems, new datasets, or new regions.
